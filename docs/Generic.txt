Supported characters: Code 39 can encode uppercase letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and some special characters (-, ., $, /, +, %, space).

Code structure: Each character is represented by 9 elements (5 bars and 4 spaces), 3 of which are wide and 6 are narrow.

Start and stop character: The code begins and ends with an asterisk (*).

Variable length: Code 39 is of variable length, so it can encode up to 43 characters.

Quiet zones: Quiet zones (blank spaces before and after the code) must be at least 10 times the width of the narrowest module.

Therefore, it is not the value 0 or 1 that determines whether it is a bar or a space, but the position in the pattern:

By position, we mean 1-based position.

Odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) = Bars
Even positions (2, 4, 6, 8) = Spaces
